<p class="col-8 mx-auto mx4 pb4 pt1">What started as a vision turned into a labor of love when Rachel and Nathan Schermerhorn purchased the barn in Rome City, Indiana in 2012. A year before the restoration process began in 2012, the barn was listed as one of the top 10 most endangered historical landmarks in Indiana. With support from the community, family and friends, the mission to transform the barn to Sylvan Cellars event center was underway. Staying in line with the rustic style and atmosphere of the barn while adding a touch of elegance, the space is equipped with 30-foot high gabled ceilings, chandeliers and the original salvaged stained wood floors. The barn officially opened for business as an event center in Spring 2015, then opened the Tasting Room in January 2016, with future plans to add on a brewery.</p>
