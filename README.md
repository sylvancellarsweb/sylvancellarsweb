# Sylvan Cellars Website

## Current Website Exigency

The website is supposed to drive traffic, provide up-to-date accurate and helpful information, inspire confidence, make it easy to do business and ultimately increase and improve business. Unfortunately, the current website has failed to meet any of those website goals. An objective, third party [website quality audit by Lighthouse on the current website](/current-website-lighthouse-report.pdf) shows just how poorly the website is at performance, accessibility and use of best practices while it does perform 'ok' in SEO.

## New Website Solution

The all new Sylvan Cellars Events & Tasting Room website was built with a ‘mobile first’ philosophy using Googles’ AMP HTML. The new website was designed and developed using Google best practices, recommendations, code, design and build process. All decisions made on the website were target customer focused and derived from data to ensure the website successfully meets all of its intended goals. The new website quality audit by Lighthouse shows extreme improvement in all key performance indicators of website success; performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO and even the addition of Progressive Web App technology. Furthermore, ownership and/or staff will find updating the new website easy and blazing fast using mobile phone, tablet and/or desktop.

- Current website is not being updated routinely as it’s too difficult and time consuming
